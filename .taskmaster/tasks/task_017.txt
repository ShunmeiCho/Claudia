# Task ID: 17
# Title: Unsupervised Semantic Navigation & Path Planning (YOLO-enhanced)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13, 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop an unsupervised semantic navigation system. The system should learn to associate natural language commands (e.g., "take me to the library") with spatial locations on the SLAM map, using YOLO-detected object contexts for semantic understanding. Implement curiosity-driven exploration and reinforcement learning for path planning and obstacle avoidance.
# Details:
Integrate LLM for understanding navigation commands. The system needs to: 1. Learn semantic labels for areas on the map (e.g., area with 'bookshelves' and 'desks' is 'library') based on YOLO detections and user interaction/guidance. 2. Implement a path planner (e.g., A*, D*) operating on the SLAM map. 3. Use reinforcement learning (RL) or an information gain approach (curiosity-driven) for exploration of unknown areas. 4. Implement dynamic obstacle avoidance using LiDAR and camera data. The navigation should be goal-oriented based on semantic understanding.

# Test Strategy:
Test navigation to semantically defined goals (e.g., "go to the area with the sofa"). Evaluate path planning efficiency and obstacle avoidance capabilities. Assess exploration strategy in new environments. Verify learning of new semantic locations. Navigation accuracy target <0.5m position error.
