# Task ID: 16
# Title: Unsupervised SLAM & Environment Mapping (YOLO-enhanced)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 15
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement an unsupervised SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system. Utilize fused multi-modal sensor data, particularly LiDAR point clouds enhanced by YOLO-detected objects as semantic landmarks, for robust self-organizing map construction and topological structure discovery.
# Details:
Choose or develop an unsupervised SLAM algorithm suitable for ROS2 and the available sensors (e.g., graph-based SLAM). Input: fused data from Task 15. Key aspects: use YOLO-detected stable objects (e.g., 'door', 'desk') as semantic landmarks to improve loop closure detection and map consistency. Focus on building a 2D or 2.5D map initially. The system should autonomously discover the environment's topological connections.

# Test Strategy:
Deploy the robot in a test environment. Evaluate map accuracy and consistency generated by SLAM. Verify correct identification and use of semantic landmarks. Test loop closure performance. Assess localization accuracy within the generated map (target <0.5m error).
