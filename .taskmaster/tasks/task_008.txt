# Task ID: 8
# Title: Japanese ASR System (NVIDIA Parakeet-TDT CTC 0.6B)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Deploy the NVIDIA Parakeet-TDT CTC 0.6B Japanese ASR model (`nvidia/parakeet-tdt_ctc-0.6b-ja`) on the Jetson Orin NX. Optimize its performance using NVIDIA TensorRT and integrate it with the audio input stream from Go2's microphone array.
# Details:
Download the Parakeet-TDT CTC 0.6B Japanese model. Convert and optimize it for TensorRT on the Jetson Orin NX. Develop a Python service that takes an audio stream (post-wake word detection) from Go2's microphone array, performs ASR, and outputs the recognized Japanese text. Implement audio pre-processing suitable for the model and microphone characteristics. Aim for low latency.

# Test Strategy:
Test ASR accuracy with various Japanese spoken commands relevant to the PRD. Measure end-to-end ASR latency (target < 500ms). Evaluate performance in noisy environments. Target ASR accuracy >90% in quiet, >80% in noisy environments.
