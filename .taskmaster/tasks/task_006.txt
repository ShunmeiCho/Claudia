# Task ID: 6
# Title: LED Control System Implementation (Compatible & Adaptive)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a Python module to control the Go2's front LED array using the `unitree_go::msg::LowCmd` message, specifically the `uint8[12] led` field. Implement Cluadia-specific LED status indicators ensuring compatibility with system default LED states and include environment light adaptation.
# Details:
Create a Python class/module that interfaces with `unitree_sdk2py` to send `LowCmd` messages. Map Cluadia states to specific LED patterns: Green double flash (唤醒确认), Blue solid (处理语音), Orange solid (执行动作), White short 3 flashes (动作完成), Red triple flash (错误/无法理解). These must be distinct from system defaults (Green solid:开机, Blue flashing:校准, Yellow flashing:低电, White solid:搜索灯). Implement logic to read ambient light from the front camera (or a dedicated sensor if available) and adjust LED brightness accordingly. Reference: `led_` field in `/usr/local/include/unitree/go2_idl/LowCmd_.hpp`.

# Test Strategy:
Visually verify each Cluadia-specific LED pattern can be triggered via Python script. Confirm that system default LED states are not overridden or interfered with. Test LED brightness adjustment in varying light conditions. LED state switching latency < 200ms.
