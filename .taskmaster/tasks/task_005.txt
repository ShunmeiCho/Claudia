# Task ID: 5
# Title: Intel RealSense D435i Integration & Data Acquisition
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate the Intel RealSense D435i depth camera. Verify the `ros-foxy-realsense2-camera (v4.51.1)` package installation and ensure RGB, depth, and infrared data streams are accessible within the ROS2 Foxy environment.
# Details:
Confirm `ros-foxy-realsense2-camera` (version 4.51.1) is installed and configured. Launch the RealSense ROS2 node (`ros2 launch realsense2_camera rs_launch.py`). Verify that topics for RGB images (e.g., `/camera/color/image_raw`), depth images (e.g., `/camera/depth/image_rect_raw`), aligned depth images (e.g., `/camera/aligned_depth_to_color/image_raw`), and point clouds (e.g., `/camera/depth/color/points`) are published. Ensure camera serial number 346522073864 is recognized. Prioritize 4D LiDAR L1, but ensure D435i is ready as an enhancement.

# Test Strategy:
Successfully launch RealSense node. Use `ros2 topic echo` or `rviz2` to visualize RGB, depth, and point cloud data from D435i. Verify depth resolution (e.g., 1280x720@30fps) and minimum depth distance (0.105m). Confirm all 6 video devices are available if applicable.
