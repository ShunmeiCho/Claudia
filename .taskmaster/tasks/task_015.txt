# Task ID: 15
# Title: Multi-modal Sensor Fusion Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a framework for fusing data from multiple modalities: 4D LiDAR L1 (point clouds), Go2 front camera (visual features, YOLO detections), RealSense D435i (RGB-D, YOLO detections), IMU (motion data), and foot-end force sensors (contact data).
# Details:
Design a ROS2-based data fusion pipeline. Implement time synchronization for sensor data streams. Fuse LiDAR geometric features with YOLO-derived semantic features from camera images. Incorporate depth information from RealSense for 3D scene understanding. Use IMU data for motion compensation and state estimation. Integrate foot-end force sensor data for terrain assessment or contact detection. The output should be a richer, more robust representation of the environment and robot state.

# Test Strategy:
Visualize fused data in RViz2 (e.g., point clouds colored by semantic labels from YOLO). Verify improved environmental representation compared to single sensor modalities. Test robustness of fusion to individual sensor noise or temporary outages.
