# Task ID: 2
# Title: Install Core Unitree SDKs (`unitree_sdk2`, `unitree_ros2`)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Install the core Unitree SDKs: `unitree_sdk2` (CycloneDDS based) and `unitree_ros2` (ROS2 integration package). This task has been completed successfully with comprehensive installation and verification of all SDK components.
# Details:
Successfully installed and verified complete Unitree SDK ecosystem including: 4 Unitree ROS2 packages (unitree_api, unitree_go, unitree_hg, unitree_ros2_example), 43 message interfaces (including critical LowCmd, LowState, SportModeState, Request, Response), 33 SDK library files (C++ compilation libraries and bindings), and full ROS2 integration. Created comprehensive installation tools including setup script (scripts/setup/install_unitree_sdks.sh), environment configuration (.env.unitree_sdk), and detailed installation report (unitree_sdk_installation_report.md). All system dependencies, repository integrity, compilation verification, interface testing, communication testing, and Python integration have been validated successfully.

# Test Strategy:
All tests completed successfully: CycloneDX workspace compilation verified, all 43 Unitree message interfaces accessible via ROS2 (`ros2 msg list | grep unitree`), DDS communication functioning properly, Python message package imports working, and comprehensive 489-line verification script validates entire installation. System is ready for unitree_sdk2py Python interface installation and robot communication testing.
