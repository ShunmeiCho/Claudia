# Task ID: 7
# Title: Wake Word Detection System (PicoVoice Porcupine for Japanese)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate the PicoVoice Porcupine wake word detection engine. Train and deploy custom Japanese wake word models for "ねえ、くら" (primary) and "くらこい" (secondary). Implement a low-power continuous listening loop.
# Details:
Install PicoVoice Porcupine Python SDK. Use the Picovoice Console to create `.ppn` model files for the Japanese wake words "ねえ、くら" and "くらこい". Write a Python script that uses the Go2's microphone array (via `unitree_sdk2py` or system audio) as input for Porcupine. Implement a loop that continuously processes audio chunks and triggers an event upon wake word detection. Ensure low CPU usage (<10% on one core) and memory footprint (<5MB).

# Test Strategy:
Test wake word detection accuracy for "ねえ、くら" and "くらこい" in quiet and noisy environments. Measure detection latency (<100ms). Monitor CPU and memory usage during continuous listening. Verify robustness against false positives.
