# Task ID: 9
# Title: Japanese TTS System (`esnya/japanese_speecht5_tts`)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Deploy the `esnya/japanese_speecht5_tts` text-to-speech model on the Jetson Orin NX for Japanese voice synthesis. Integrate with a HiFiGAN vocoder for quality audio output through Go2's built-in speaker. Allow dynamic enabling/disabling of TTS output.
# Details:
Set up the `japanese_speecht5_tts` model (144M parameters) and a compatible HiFiGAN vocoder. Use `SpeechT5FeatureExtractor` and `SpeechT5Processor`. Implement logic for multi-sentence processing to handle pauses correctly. Configure 16-dim speaker embeddings for voice personalization (e.g., male/female). Create a Python service that accepts Japanese text and generates speech audio, outputting through Go2's speaker. Implement a runtime switch to enable/disable TTS.

# Test Strategy:
Test TTS naturalness (target MOS > 4.0/5.0) and intelligibility for various Japanese sentences. Measure synthesis latency (target < 200ms for short phrases). Verify dynamic enable/disable of audio output. Test different speaker embeddings.
